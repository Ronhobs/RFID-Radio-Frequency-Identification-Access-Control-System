This project will involve simulating the RFID reader and tags, verifying access permissions, and controlling access to a simulated door or gate. We'll simulate the system in C/C++ and provide a web interface to demonstrate the system.

Project Overview
RFID Simulation: Simulate RFID tags and a reader.
Access Control Logic: Implement logic to grant or deny access based on RFID tag ID.
Web Interface: Create a web interface to demonstrate the access control system.

Steps to Implement the Project

1.Setup Development Environment
2.Simulate RFID Reader and Tags
3.Implement Access Control Logic
4.Create Web Interface for Simulation
5. Integrate and Test
